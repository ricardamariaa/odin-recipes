        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This cold tomato soup, also called gazpacho (it's Spanish) can be cooked without a stove. It is 
            a summery dish and easy to make. You will enjoy it!</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>About 2 pounds ripe red tomatoes, cored and roughly cut into chunks</li>
            <li>1 Italian frying (cubanelle) pepper or another long, light green pepper, such as Anaheim,
                cored, seeded and roughly cut into chunks</li>
            <li>1 cucumber, about 8 inches long, peeled and roughly cut into chunks</li>
            <li>1 small mild onion (white or red), peeled and roughly cut into chunks</li>
            <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
            <li>Some sherry vinegar</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine tomatoes, pepper, cucumber, onion and garlic in a blender or, if using a hand
            blender, in a deep bowl. (If necessary, work in batches.) Blend at high speed until very
            smooth, at least 2 minutes, pausing occasionally to scrape down the sides with a rubber
            spatula.</li>
            <li>With the motor running, add the vinegar and 2 teaspoons salt. Slowly drizzle in the olive
            oil. The mixture will turn bright orange or dark pink and become smooth and emulsified,
            like a salad dressing. If it still seems watery, drizzle in more olive oil until texture
            is creamy.</li>
            <li>Strain the mixture through a strainer or a food mill, pushing all the liquid through with
            a spatula or the back of a ladle. Discard the solids. Transfer to a large pitcher (preferably
            glass) and chill until very cold, at least 6 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Before serving, adjust the seasonings with salt and vinegar. If soup is very thick, stir
            in a few tablespoons ice water. Serve in glasses, over ice if desired, or in a bowl.
            A few drops of olive oil on top are a nice touch.</li>
        </ol>
